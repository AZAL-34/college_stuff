            <h1>welcome to the abyss</h1>
            <p>i understand you may have some questions.</p>
            <h2>what is this place?</h2>
            <p>this is the abyss. i thought i already made that clear.</p>
            <h2>how did i get here?</h2>
            <p>i'm just as clueless as you on that front. i was very diligent in blocking off all the entrances.</p>
            <h2>who are you?</h2>
            <p>i go by many names. for you - hmm, let's go with... azalea. yeah, that's a nice one, i think.</p>
            <h2>how do i leave this place?</h2>
            <p>again, i was very diligent in blocking off all access points. my guess would be the same way you got in.</p>
            <h2>is there anything i can do while i'm here?</h2>
            <p>umm... i think i have some games you can probably borrow. let's see... i've got undertale, deltarune, cuphead, ultrakill, and the entire kirby series. oh, and hollow knight. you can't borrow that one though, since i'm playing it myself at the moment. oh, and there's a tv over there. all it has is gravity falls, though.</p>
